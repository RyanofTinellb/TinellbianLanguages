<h1>External History</h1>
<p>I have been interested in language and linguistics since at least the age of 10. I remember making up words when I was quite young. In fact, the High Lulani word <strong>mica</strong> <em>hello</em> dates from that time.</p>
<p>When I decided to write a novel, a constructed language (conlang) was an obvious prospect for inclusion in the background information. I had the beginnings of what was to be the Ptokan language, and the language of the Fezhl&ecirc;. The latter  was once designed as a daughter language of Ptokan, but it had some features, mostly phonological, that seemed to come from an earlier language. Thus was Lulani born. Originally intended to be a phonology sketch, Lulani has expanded greatly into a language in its own right. So much so, in fact, that Ptokan and Fezhl&ecirc; have been forced to change somewhat to adapt.</p>
